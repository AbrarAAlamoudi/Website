    "text": "“How to Be a Modern Scientist” by Jeff Leek\nThis book is an amazing book that describes the effect of artificial intelligence and novel strategies on recent scientists. Multiple principles have been presented in a sample and interesting way. I will summarize some of these principles in the following blog.\nContradictory to the old protocol where we see the research results without any transparency and openness in research, the modern scientist is recommended to share their data, code, and methodologies to facilitate reproducibility and collaboration of the research such a way would help others to continue to discover a new era. The researcher also advised adopting new tools, methodologies, and different environments. Collaboration with experts from different fields to address complex problems can lead to innovative solutions. Delivering the research findings to the public or scientific community using a clear and accessible language with various media formats to facilitate message delivery. Advocate for the importance of science and evidence-based decision-making in society. Engage with policymakers and the public to promote understanding and support for scientific research. Lastly, try to use the media to self-advertise your progress.\nThe book took 4-6 hours to finish. I would recommend any new scientist to read before starting his journey."
